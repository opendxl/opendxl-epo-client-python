## Overview

The [McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator](https://www.mcafee.com/us/products/epolicy-orchestrator.aspx) (ePO) DXL Python
client library provides a high level wrapper for invoking ePO remote commands via the
[Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx) (DXL) fabric.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to invoke ePO remote commands without having to focus
on lower-level details such as ePO-specific DXL topics and message formats.

This client requires an ePO DXL service to be running and available on the DXL fabric. 

A Python-based implementation of an ePO DXL service is available here:
* [McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) DXL Python Service](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-epo-service-python)
